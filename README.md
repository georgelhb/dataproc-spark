#### Cloud Dataproc is a fast, easy-to-use, fully-managed cloud service for running Apache Spark and Apache Hadoop clusters in a simpler, more cost-efficient way. The demo shows how to run a Spark job to estimates a value of Pi using the Monte Carlo method on a Dataproc cluster.
---
1) Create a Dataproc cluster: <br/>
2) Submit a Spark job: <br/>
```

Main class or jar: org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi
Arguments: 1000 (This sets the number of tasks.)
Jar file: file:///usr/lib/spark/examples/jars/spark-examples.jar
```
3) View the job output: <br/>
```
Check Line wrapping or scroll all the way to the right to see the calculated value of Pi.
